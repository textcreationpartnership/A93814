            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE STATE OF SION COLLEGE <hi>LONDON,</hi> 1681.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſaid College was founded by Dr. <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Vicar of St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the Weſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and confirmed by the Charters of the Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and Second. It is governed by a Preſident, two Deans, and four Aſſiſtants, annually choſen out of the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> who are all Fellows of the ſaid College.</p>
            <p>It conſiſts of a Hall, Library, other publick Rooms, Chambers for Students, and a Hoſpital for twenty poor aged People, men and women.</p>
            <p>In the dreadful Fire of <hi>London</hi> all the Buildings were conſumed, a third part of the Books burnt, and Rents loſt to the yearly value of one hundred and ſix Pounds, ſix Shillings.</p>
            <p>By the Charity of ſeveral worthy Benefactors (whoſe names are to be ſeen in the Publick Regiſter kept in the Library) the ſaid Library and Hoſpital were ſoon rebuilt in as good or better manner than before the Fire; The Hall and publick Rooms are brought up to the Roof, and covered. There hath been already expended in theſe Works the Sum of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds and upwards, and it will require about Four Hundred Pounds more to finiſh them.</p>
            <p>Beſides the great loſs of Rents, before-mentioned, the Lands which were appropriated to the maintenance of the Poor are within theſe few years ſunk from One hundred and twenty to Seventy Pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> ſo that the Penſions of the Poor which were formerly Six Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> are now fallen to Three pounds ten. And though the Salaries of the Clerk and other Officers have been leſſened, and divers other Expences wholly taken away, the College is yet indebted near Four hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>It is therefore humbly recommended to all the lovers of Piety and Learning, as a proper object for their charity and munificence, that by their aſſiſtance the debts of the ſaid College may be diſcharged, the remaining part of the Buildings finiſhed, and the Poor receive the ſame comfortable allowances which they formerly enjoyed.</p>
            <p>And for the ſpeedy finiſhing of the Buildings, it may be conſidered that it will be much for the credit of this Honourable City, not to ſuffer any part of the ſaid College to lie in ruines, here being the only publick Library in <hi>London,</hi> whither divers Strangers and Foreiners are wont to reſort.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ſhall be pleaſed to contribute any thing towards all or any of the purpoſes herein expreſſed, are deſired to lodge their Charity in the hands of ſome of the Governours, or other Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> to be delivered to ſome of the Governours for the time being, to be by them imployed according to the intent of the Donors.</p>
